What I Learned

Even though the project didn’t run successfully, I learned a lot during the process:

How to set up a Node.js backend using Express.

How to install and use important backend packages like express, mongoose, dotenv, and nodemon.

The importance of .env files to protect sensitive data (like MongoDB connection strings).

How to connect to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose.

The basic structure of a backend project, including models, routes, and config files.

How environment variables are accessed using process.env.

The flow of starting a backend server with npm start or npm run dev.

Problems I Faced

Module Not Found Errors: I got errors when files were not named properly or the paths were incorrect.

MongoDB URI Issues: I forgot to replace <password> with the actual database password in the connection string.

Nodemon Crashing: It kept crashing when the main file (like app.js or server.js) wasn’t found.

First-Time Backend Challenges: As a frontend developer, it was a new experience to handle backend logic and folder setup.

Final Note

Even though the backend didn’t run fully, I made a strong effort, and now I understand where things went wrong. This was a valuable part of my learning journey. I’ll keep improving and trying until it works!
